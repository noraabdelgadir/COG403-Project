# C0G403-Project

## Overview

Despite how bilingualism is common throughout the world, with around half of the world's population being able to speak at least two languages, there is still a lot that is not understood about language processing in the bilingual brain. This project is done to test whether or not bilinguals share a common semantic network between the two languages in their brain through testing whether two words in different languages are in the same semantic space.

## Methods

- K-means clustering
- Neural network
